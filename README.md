## Obtain api keys 
- Create Wolfram account if you don't have one at [this link](https://account.wolfram.com/login/create)
- IF you have once, login and go to [this link](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/), create app api key.
- Add the api key by go to option page

- I inject my temporary key here due to this extension still beta, so you can use the directly, but api call limit each month is just 2000, so if you want to use it more, you need to create your own key.
